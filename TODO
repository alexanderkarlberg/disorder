Items to be done before release/publication of v1.0:

*) cmake?

*) Clean up code (e.g. gluon only)

*) write paper

*) Fix pdf interface so it uses fixed nf in the coupling as
 well. Check consistency between disent and hoppet

*) COLFOR has a weird feature that W(0) is set to zero in a very
 complicated way. Check against results from Alex.

*) Do check with Alex at LO/NLO/NNLO

*) Add charged current to inclsuive ME (needs testing). For sure an
 overall factor missing due to helicity average (5/4?)

*) Add support for reduced cross sections

*) Check on grid violationsin proVBFH. Maybe the upper bound is not set correctly?
