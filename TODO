Items to be done before release/publication of v1.0:

*) Modify the histogramming/analysis routines so that they
   1) Handle multiple weights properly when doing scale uncert
   2) Print header information (need a header class somehwere to store all the info)

*) Modify disent so it can pass an array of weights when doing scale
 variation (virtwo, virthr, colthr and colfor seem to be the issue
 here. They all call KPFUNS which is where the scale variation takes
 place)

*) cmake?

*) Clean up code (e.g. gluon only)

*) write paper
