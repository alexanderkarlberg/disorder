Items to be done before release/publication of v1.0:

*) cmake?

*) Clean up code (e.g. gluon only)

*) write paper

*) COLFOR has a weird feature that W(0) is set to zero in a very
 complicated way. Check against results from Alex.

*) Do check with Alex at LO/NLO/NNLO

*) Add support for reduced cross sections

*) Ask Valerio about W+/W- convention...

*) Need to check the lab frame transformations again since now the
 Breit frame momenta swapped sign...
